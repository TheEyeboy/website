                <h4>Question: How does online education work on a day-to-day basis?</h4>
                <p>[Answer] Instructional methods, course requirements, and learning technologies can
                     vary significantly from one online program to the next, but the vast bulk of them use a
                      learning management system (LMS) to deliver lectures and materials,
                     monitor student progress, assess comprehension, and accept student work.
                 LMS providers design these platforms to accommodate a multitude of instructor needs and preferences.</p>

                <h4>Question: Can you really earn online degrees in hands-on fields like Coding and engineering?</h4>
                <p>[Answer] Yes and no. While schools do offer online and hybrid programs in these disciplines,
                     students must usually meet additional face-to-face training requirements. Schools usually
                      establish these requirements with convenience in mind. For example, students in fields like computer science, 
                    teaching, and social work may be required to complete supervised fieldwork or educational
                    placements, but do so through local schools, technological companies, and other organizations.</p>

                <h4>Question: Is online education as effective as face-to-face instruction?</h4>
                <p>
                    [Answer] Online education may seem relatively new, but years of research suggests it can be just as effective as traditional coursework, and often more so. According to a U.S.
                     Department of Education analysis of more than 1,000 learning studies, online students tend to outperform classroom-based students across most disciplines and demographics.

                <h4>Question: Do employers accept online degrees?</h4>
                <p>[Answer] All new learning innovations are met with some degree of scrutiny,
                     but skepticism subsides as methods become more mainstream. Such is the case for online learning. 
                     Studies indicate employers who are familiar with online degrees tend to view them more favorably, and more employers are acquainted with them than ever before.
                      The majority of colleges now offer online degrees, including most public, not-for-profit, and Ivy League universities.
                     Online learning is also increasingly prevalent in the workplace as more companies invest in web-based employee training and development programs.</p>

                <h4>Question: Is online education more conducive to cheating?</h4>
                <p>
                    [Answer] The concern that online students cheat more than traditional students is perhaps misplaced.
                     When researchers at Marshall University conducted a study to measure the prevalence of cheating in online and classroom-based courses,
                      they concluded, “somewhat surprisingly, the results showed higher rates of academic dishonesty in live courses.”
                     The authors suggest the social familiarity of students in a classroom setting may lessen their sense of moral obligation.

                <h4>Question: How do I know if online education is right for me?</h4>
                <p>
                    [Answer] Choosing the right degree program takes time and careful research no matter how one intends to study. Learning styles, goals, and programs always vary,
                     but students considering online colleges must consider technical skills, ability to self-motivate, and other factors specific to the medium.

                <h4>Question: How do I know if an online degree program is credible?</h4>
                <p>
                    [Answer] As with traditional colleges, some online schools are considered more credible than others. Reputation, post-graduation employment statistics,
                     and enrollment numbers are not always reliable indicators of quality, which is why many experts advise students to look for accredited schools. 
                     In order for an online college to be accredited, a third-party organization must review its practices, finances, instructors, and other important 
                     criteria and certify that they meet certain quality standards.
                     The certifying organization matters, too, since accreditation is only as reliable as the agency that grants it.

                <h4>Question: Do online schools offer the same student support services as traditional colleges?</h4>
                <p>
                    [Answer] Colleges and universities tend to offer online students many of the same support services as campus-based students, though they may be administered differently.
                     Instead of going to a campus library, online students may log in to virtual libraries stocked with digital materials, or work with research librarians by phone or email. 
                    Tutoring, academic advising, and career services might rely on video conferencing software, virtual meeting rooms, and other collaborative technologies.

                <div class="question__answer"></div>
                <h4>Question: What technical skills do online students need?</h4>
                <p>
                    [Answer] Online learning platforms are typically designed to be as user-friendly as possible: 
                    intuitive controls, clear instructions, and tutorials guide students through new tasks.
                     However, students still need basic computer skills to access and navigate these programs.

                <h4>Question: What technology requirements must online students meet? What if they do not meet them?</h4>
                <p>
                    [Answer] Technical requirements vary from one online degree program to the next, but most students need at minimum high-speed Internet access,
                     a keyboard, and a computer capable of running specified online learning software. Courses using identity verification tools and voice- or 
                     web-conferencing software require webcams and microphones.
                     Scanners and printers help, too. While online schools increasingly offer mobile apps for learning on-the-go, smartphones and tablets alone may not be sufficient.

                        This is something I can do as a totally non-technical person…
                        The program has been very eye-opening and challenging in a positive way.
                        I have learned so much in such a short period of time.
                        I really owe that to this program… to changing the entire trajectory of my life.
                        I am so grateful for that.

                        I have always enjoyed problem solving and board games as a child. For as long as I can remember,
                         having a career in a quantitative discipline has been my goal. I chose this program because 
                         its courses and opportunities would help me stand out among other students entering the workforce upon graduation.
                          I knew this specialist program would make me a well-rounded candidate for a career as a software developer,
                           especially with theoretical courses in mathematics and statistics.
                         Whenever I had any questions, the Coding School academic advisers and admissions office were very helpful and supportive of my decisions.

                      The professors take time to make sure we are all understanding everything.
